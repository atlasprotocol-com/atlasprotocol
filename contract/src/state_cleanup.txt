https://github.com/nameskyteam/state-cleanup

1. Compile the state-cleanup contract
make all

2. Deploy the state-cleanup contract to the account which wants to be deleted (e.g. example.near)
near deploy atlas.yeowlin.testnet ./res/state_cleanup.wasm --network-id testnet

3. View the contact state and you can find the state keys with base64 encoding
near storage atlas.yeowlin.testnet --finality optimistic --network-id testnet

4. Store the results into keys.json:
	4.1 replace all single quotes ' to double quotes "
	4.2 replace key to "key"
	4.3 replace value to "value"

5. Generate all_keys.json
node prepare_keys.js

6. Clean the state keys based on all_keys.json
near call atlas.yeowlin.testnet clean "$(cat ./src/all_keys.json)" --network-id testnet --account-id yeowlin.testnet --gas 300000000000000

7. Delete the account
near delete-account atlas.yeowlin.testnet yeowlin.testnet
