# Onboarding Flow Implementation

Implementation of a 3-step onboarding flow to increase user acquisition and engagement.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Initial planning and task breakdown
- [x] Create onboarding route and page structure
- [x] Create onboarding layout with step indicators
- [x] Implement Step 1: Wallet Connection
- [x] Implement Step 2: Social Tasks (Follow X, Join Discord, RT)
- [x] Implement Step 3: Invite Code (crossed out) + Email Collection
- [x] Create mock API for checking onboarding completion
- [x] Implement onboarding completion tracking
- [x] Add proper navigation flow between steps
- [x] Implement redirect logic from home page

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Test the complete onboarding flow
- [ ] Fix any remaining TypeScript/linting issues
- [ ] Verify responsive design on mobile devices

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Integrate real API endpoints
- [ ] Add analytics tracking for onboarding funnel
- [ ] Add error handling and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing

## Implementation Plan

### Architecture Overview

The onboarding flow will be a linear 3-step process:

1. **Step 1**: Wallet Connection (reuse existing ConnectModal)
2. **Step 2**: Social Tasks (Follow X, Join Discord, Retweet)
3. **Step 3**: Invite Code (strikethrough) + Email Collection + Access Atlas

### Flow Logic

- Users without connected wallet → redirect to `/onboarding`
- Users with connected wallet → check API if onboarding completed
- If completed → redirect to home
- If not completed → continue from appropriate step
- Linear flow (no back navigation)

### Social Task URLs

- X Account: https://x.com/_atlasprotocol
- Discord: TBD (empty for now)
- Retweet Link: https://x.com/_atlasprotocol/status/1922955202916909078

### Technical Components

- New `/onboarding` route
- Step indicator component (numbered 1,2,3)
- Social task components with "Done" button functionality
- Email collection form with validation
- Mock API service for onboarding status
- Local storage for tracking current step
- Redirect logic integration

### Design System

- Follow existing design patterns from ConnectModal
- Use existing Button, Dialog, Input components
- Maintain consistent colors, spacing, typography
- Responsive design principles

### Environment Setup

- No additional dependencies required
- Uses existing design system and components
- Mock API will be implemented first, real API integration later

### Current Implementation Status

✅ **MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED**: Full onboarding flow implemented with all three steps, redirect logic, and mock API integration.

The onboarding flow is now fully functional with:

1. **Step 1**: Wallet connection using existing ConnectModal
2. **Step 2**: Social tasks (Follow X, Join Discord, Retweet) with done button functionality
3. **Step 3**: Invite code section (crossed out) + email collection + Access Atlas button
4. **Redirect Logic**: Users are automatically redirected to onboarding if wallet not connected or onboarding not completed
5. **Mock API**: Local storage-based API for tracking onboarding completion status
6. **Responsive Design**: Following existing design system patterns
